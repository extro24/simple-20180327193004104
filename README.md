# Freicoin Poker
Just for fun, poker game for use with Freicoin (or other crypto coins) that is like a video game.

To make it run you have to edit several files. Mainly includes/config.php with database details. 
Also search for the connections to the coin daemon for processing.

Also the coin daemon needs in coin file walletnotify=/usr/bin/php /path/to/walletnotify.php %s to get notified of the payment.

Reminder: The software is old and not maintained anymore.
